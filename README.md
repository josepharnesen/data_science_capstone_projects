# data_science_capstone_projects
Projects created and implemented in BYU's data science capstone class.

Classification_homework:
  This homework shows multiple different methods for classification and then compares their various accuracies against each other. 
  
Final Models:
  As part of our final exam we had to create a feedforward model, a CNN model, and then write code for some NLP tasks. This code shows what those models look like. 
  We didn't have to use the first two models, but the structure of a typical feedforward model and a CNN model are there. 
  For the NLP tasks we used the first couple of verses from the Bible and removed puncuation, stop words, and capitilization. We also lemmatized and tokenized the words. Finally
  we created a term matrix to see how many times a word showed up in the new lemmatized and tokenized lists.
